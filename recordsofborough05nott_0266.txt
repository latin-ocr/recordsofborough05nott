2 30 RECORDS or THE BOROUGH or NOTTINGHAM. [1644

ί2. Χνο0 are constrained to certifye‚ that if they shall desert vs,
‘both this Guarrison and County will bee left A pray for the enraged
‘enemy (of whose Tiranny wee haue beene soe sensible), and now
‘they gape for an oportunity, hopeinge that th'eis vnhappy divisions
‘will yeild them that advantage which otherwise they despaired of. 5

‘3. That if theis gentlemen (beeinge soe well experienct in the
‘affaires of the County), should now leave vs, there is not any well-
‘affected (that wee know), who vnderstand the state thereos, or can
‘proceed with such vigoure and successe as (through God's blessinge)‚
‘they haue hitherto doone, but in probability all will growe to 10
‘confusion.

‘4. That though the Governor and his brother bee absent, (blessed
‘bee God), this Guarrison hath beene and is in A quiett and happy
‘condicion‚ and noe disobedience or refractorInes in any officers or
‘souldiers (that wee can pcrceffle), but all are chearefull, vnanimous, 15

‘passionate and violent Carriage of the Governor, that they will 25
‘rather lay downe their armes and quitt the Garrison then endure
‘such slavery.

ί6. That wee vnderstand some of our pious and conscionable
‘ministers (here resideinge)‚ by whose godly labours amongst vs this
‘Garrison (without doubt), hath prospered much better then otherwise 30
‘it could haue doone, and by whom our hearts haue been much
‘supported in the midst of all distresses‚ yet by those parties and
‘prosequutors aboue are most vncivilly vsed, and with Cavallier—like
‘language abused, One beeinge called to his face, “proud preist‚'’
“‘peevish preist‚'' and “factious preist‚’' haueing the lye given vnto 35
‘hym‚ and A trencher offered to bee throne at his head, an other that
‘his preaching is factious; wee can not but iustify them both to bee
‘Orthodox, painfull‚ and profitable preachers‚ who are not inclined to
‘facti0n, but doe wholly endevour to preserve peace and vnity in this
