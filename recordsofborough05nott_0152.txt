CHARLES‚ by the grace of God kinge of England, Scotland, 5
Fraunce and Ireland, defender of the saith, etc, To our trustie and
welbeloved the mayor and Aldermen of the Towne of Nottingham
Greetinge :

When the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme descended first
vpon vs, wee found ourselves engaged in a warre vndertaken and10
entred into by our late deare Father of blessed memorie not
willinglie‚ nor vpon light or ill grounded Councells, but by the many
provocatz'ons of an ambitious Enemy, and by the grave and de-
liberate Councells and perswasions of both the houses of Parliament
vpon promise of theire continual} assistance therein, and thereby not 15
our selves alone and our owne people became thus engaged, but also
our friendes and 311165, and amongst them, and above all others, our
most deare vncle, the most illustrious king, the king of Denmarke,
who hath in his owne person imbarqued himself in the same quarrell‚
whome in honor and in reason of State, we maie not desert, but by 20
the advise 01 0111 Councell we resolved to assist him p7‘esentlie2 with
men and money, we evidentlie forseeing that otherwise our Common
Enemy3 will in an instant become master of all Germany, and con-
sequentlie of all the portes and partes where the masse and bulke 01
0111 Cloth is vented,4 and whence we must furnish ourselves of pro· 25
vision for our Shipping‚ which howe 131311 11 would be to vs and our
people maie 6351116 be discerned; but when wee came to enter into
11115 greate worke, wee found our Treasures exhausted, and our
Coffers empty, and our ordinarie Revenue hardlie sufficient to sup-
port our ordinarie charge, much lesse to vndergoe soe greate and 30
extraordinarie 3 burthen 35 3 1ν3116 with Spaine.

Our affaires thus standing, wee beinge willing to treade in the
stepps of our Auncestors, with all the convenient speede wee could,
