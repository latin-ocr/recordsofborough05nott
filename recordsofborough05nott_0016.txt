X INTRODUCTION.

The presentments at the Sessions throughout the troubled reign
of Charles I. are very numerous, but the kindred character of the
substance of the majority of them with that of the presentments so
liberally exampled in the earlier volumes of this work, has made the
always invidious task of selection an exceptionally difficult one.
Among the Latin presentments, those against persons using trades
to which they had not been apprenticed, are <if ordinary felonies be
left out of consideration) of most frequent occurrence, and among
the English ones, those against recusants and scolds are multiplied
ad nauscam. Of the first-named only one specimen will be found
here, as an action for the same offence has already been printed in
full in the fourth volume, and of the two latter class, though the
examples given may be thought by some more than sufficient, only
a very small proportion is really represented in this volume. The
bundles are twenty in number (only three of which belong to the
reign of Charles 11.)â€šand from these the Mickletorn Jury rolls,
which, as before, were found rolled up with the Sessions rolls, have
now been detached and separatcly numbered. The selections here
printed sufficiently indicate the general character of the Mickletorn
Jury presentmentS, one of the most noteworthy features of which,
perhaps, is the constant resistance they evidence, on the part of the
authorities, to building and other encroachments, Of presentments
for the latter, however, space has been found for but comparatively
few, and these, it must be understood, are merely representative, not
exceptional, instances of their class. The same remark, it should be
added, applies equally to the Latin Sessions' presentments for
felonies, of which, also, a very considerable number has been pre-
served. In the cases of both Latin and English presentments, the
