been several times invaded, plundered, and impoverished by the
enemies of the King and Parliament’ (p. 225). A conveyance of
the rent to the Corporation was effected on the 3rd September, 1650,
the purchase money of which would appear from a minute of
July 12 of the same year (p. 266) to have been actually pald, but
the Conveyance was ignored by Charles 11., and the see-farm rents
throughout the kingdom were subsequently sold to private in-
dividuals. Although the Corporation‚ as time went on, derived less
and less benefit from the ‘tolla royalties, and perquisites' mentioned
in the petition, it continued to pay the rent to private persons till
May 6, 1891, when, at a considerable eost, a second and final Con-

The arbitrary character of the Stuart rule is illustrated by more
than one document in the present volume. That the people were

printed at pp. 116-118, is couched in comparatively moderate terms,
though its tone grows somewhat minatory towards the close, and

showed himself, in breaking his engagements with his subjects‚ when-
ever it so pleased him, his assurance ‘we faithfully promise and
undertake on the royal word of a King, which we will be jealous
(zeareful) not to break with our people,' can scarcely bc read without
a smile. In the letters ofJune 30, and August 23, 1627 (pp. 125-128>‚
the King's displeasure at the inadequacy of the sums collected is very
marked, the demand for contributions is reiterated in terms much
more peremptory, and there is a singular and almost pathetic blending
of threatening with persuasive and conciliatory language which is very
characteristic. In the Charters of Charles II. and James II., and the
mandates of the latter substituting for the municipal officers then

existing, others more to the liking of the royal mind, the despotic
