xiv INTRODUCTION.

nearly two years that the allegations against the Colonel were
ordered to be cancelled. That, in the meantime, a general recog-
nition of his very real and rare merits had followed on a more
intimate experience, is evidenced by the fact that on November 23,
1645, he was sworn burgesS, and the usual see of 7510 was restored to
him by the Council, on the ground, among others alleged, that ‘he
had done faithful and good service in his place to the State and
garrison' (p. 239). A pleasing circumstance, and one which reveals
a more amiable trait in his character than could be inferred from his
Puritanic austerity, is that he gave five of the ten pounds to the
poor, and the company ten shillings ‘to drink.’

The rigorous orders of the Governor to the Nottingham Garrison
of December, 1644, printed as an appendix at p. 423, will be read
with interest, and, perhaps als‘o, with some amusement, in the present
day. The intolerant and fanatical spirit they certainly betray goes
far to explain the reaction which, not many years afterwards, set in
against the Puritan party in England. Indeed, so early as 1656, a
‘son of Belial flown with insolence and wine' (or ale), already
appears in the humble person of a felt-makes of Friar Row‚ william
Bradshaw by name, presented at the Sessions on the 13th December
of that year, for having in his cups impugned the authority of the
scriptural narrative of the miraculous multiplication of loaves and
fishes‚ and confirmed his asseverations with an oath (p. 290). A dis-
position to rebel against Puritan rule was openly evinced on the
20th July——the Lord’s day—of the following year, by a popular
tumult occasioned by the constables walking the streets ‘to restrain
children and servants from sports and pastime.’ There is, it may be
remarked in passing, a strong flavour of Puritanism in the present-
ments for this period, persons of both sexes being charged with
cursing and swearing on the Sabbath day, ancl children with fishing
and playing; and there is a request from the west side ‘that
travelling on the Sabbath day may be prevented' (p. 293). The
constables are also found presenting Lady Hutchinson for having
‘music in her house on the Sabbath day, the 12 of October, 1654'
