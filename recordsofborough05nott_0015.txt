interest for the first volume, have contributed nothing whatever to
the present one. Twelve of these books are extant, but though they
are sufficiently portly to promise much at a first view, only the
barest particulars are given of the suits entered in them, and it was
not found possible to extract anything from these which could be
deemed worthy to arrest the attention of the curious student of local
history. Their general character has already been so well described
by the editor1 of the previous volumes of this work in his exhaustive
introductions, that it would be superfluous, if not, indeed, imper-
tinent‚ to attempt in any way to supplement his observations.

Arid, however, as are the general contents of the Court Books,
the following memoranda, written on a leaf (page 83 a), of the Court
Book for 1642-7, are not without a certain interest :—
