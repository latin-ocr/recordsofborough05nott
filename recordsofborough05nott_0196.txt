Villa Nostinglmam'ae.1—-Whereas Maistcr Bou-ne, of Councell with
the Mayor and Burgesses of the Towne of Nottingham, informed
this Coun, that by reason of an Order of this Courte made in
Michaelmas Terme, in the sixth yeere of his Maiestie's migne, by
which noe allowance was to bee given to Lords or Bayliffes of 5
Liberties of Exitus coram Barom'bns de Tem-astibus chjs,2 nor Exitus
de se,·3 the Sheriffes of the said Towne of Nottingham are stopped
in the Pipe from passinge their Accomptes3 whereas it is conceaued
that the said Order whereby they are stopped concerned Lords and
Bayliffes of Liberties‚ and not Citties or Townes Corporate: And, ιο
besides, it is conceaued that the Case of XVenlocke Libertie, men-
cioned in the said Order, by which it is adiuged that that Libertie
doth not carrye Evictus coram Barom'hus de T mentibus Regzkff doth
differ from the Case of the said Towne of Nofflngham, for they have
those issues by speciall graunts and Charters, and they have beene15
allwayes allowed vnto the said Mayor and Burgesses till the said
Order was made: And for the Statute of l'icesimo Sfsslimo chrici
Octavi, Capite vicesimo quarto? also mencioned in that Order, whereby
Bassus de sc3 are taken away from Lords of Liberties, it is also con-
ceaued it doth not extend to Citties or Townes Corporate, For their 20
Liberties and Franchesies are saved vnto them by a speciall proviso
in the said Statute, and therefore humblye prayed that the like
Allowance of the said severall Titles might bee made vnto the said
Towne of Nottingham as formerly they have had, and that they
might passe their Accompts accordingly; Inasmuch as it is not 25
determined whether the said Titles belong vnto the said Towne
vppon any speciall Clayme made by the said Towne vnto those
Titles since the makinge of the said Order of restraint, yett‚ in
respect they were formerlye allowed, and it is fitt that the Accomptes
should bee passed, It is therefore this daye ordered that the said 30
severall Titles of Exitus coram Barom’bus de T enantibus Regis‚6 and
Exitus et Amcrciamenla de se7 shall bee respited vppon the said
Sheriffs‘ Accompts vntill Easter Terme next, to the end the said
