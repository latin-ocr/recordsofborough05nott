and declare yat they are and euer were sor ye said old Charter, and
euer did and does looke vpon ye pretended Surender os yat Charter
to bee fraudulant and sureptitious ; and yat ye new Charter, obtained
there vpon, was Illegall and vnjust ; and they euer did and doe highly

the towne, and to free them from a company of ill men, who had noe
Legall right to there places, and who had very much oppressed‚
enslaued, and abuised the Towne; And for these reasons and ends,

in all the manie points of itt3 and they haue done all they can to
haisten and haue itt, till when that they must either act by the
authority they haue, or dissert ye goverment ; but yat they* may not,
must not, nor dare not doe, and therfore they must doe ye first3 and
who euer Blames them for itt, or will not assist them in itt, are, they
thinke,5 very much to blame. lb„ fo. 65.
