346 RECORDS OF THE BOROUGH OF NOTTINGHAM. [1688

Major, ye Sessions of Peace cannot be held. 'Tis desired that ye
Duke of Newcasffle, Recorder, and ye Recorder for ye time being
may bee made Justice of Peaee, and that hee, and ye eldest Alder-
man, may bee of ye Quorum, as well as ye Major.

3. The elections of Major, Aldermen, Sheriffs, Coroners, and 5
other officers of ye Corporation are made by ye Major, Α16161111611,
Council, and Burgesses who have born ye office of Sheriffs or
Chamberlains, and those that have been Sheriffs or Chamberlains
doe claim ye libertye of voting in these elections‚ though they are
displaced from ye Corporation‚ who, being many in number, will 10
carry all elections of Officers at their will.

'Tis therefore prayed that none but ye Major, Aldermen, and
Council may Vote in ye said Elections‚ and yat ye Council of Six
may bee increased to a greater number, to bee chosen out of ye
Chamberlains and Sheriffs, and to 1366 called ye1 Council of 15
ye said Town.

4. The mistake in ye late Charter concerning ye electing ye
Major to bee Rectifyed.

5. The two fairs granted by ye late Charter to bee left out, and
ye old fairs to bee restored. 20

6. To leave out ye clauses concerning ye takeing ye Oaths of
Allegiance and Supremacye and TestS, and the King's approveing ye
Recorder and Town Clerkc.

The reason why I intend to increase ye number of the Council of
Six, is to let in Such of ye Burgesses as have been Sheriffs and 25
Chamberlains, and are deserving persons, to a Share in ye Govern-
ment, ye better to exclude ye others. 4752.
Good Master Major,

I gave you ye trouble of a letter about ten days since, to enquire
of your new Charter, and what was done in it. Since then, vizt‚ this 30
morning, Ι received ye Inclosed from Masler Harcourt, a Clerke in
ye Crown Office, who is imployed for ye King in ye Quo warranto
against you. Vpon perusal‚ you will Vnderstand ye contentes; but
ye meaning of it I doe not well apprehend‚ for as to any Surrender
of your Charter, there was noe talke of it that I know of, nor can 35
there bee any Legal surrender made by ye present members ; but I
suppose hee means by surrender, letting ye King take Judgment
