FLAMSTEAD remained in office until 1652-53‚ when GREAVES was
reinstated, but the circumstances of his resumption of office are now
unknown, the Minute Book for this period being unfortunately lost.
He would appear, by some means or other, to have made his peace
with the Puritan party, and at all events, no fresh instance of open
