immunsties, and pre-eminences‚ as well by the charters of divers our
progenitors and predecessors, late Kings and Queens of England‚
heretofore made and granted and confirmed to them, as by reason of
divers prescriptions and customs used in the same town from time
5 whereof the memory of man to the contrary does not exist; and
whereas we are informed that certain ambiguities exist in many of
the charters and letters patent heretofore made to them, by reason

the same charters or letters patent; and whereas our well beloved
subjects, the Mayor and Burgesses of the town of Nottingham afore-
said, have surrendered to us the letters patent and charters aforesaid,
and all their liberties and privileges whatsoever,—which surrender we
15 have accepted, and do by these presents accept,—and have humbly
besought that we would deign to grant anew all and singular the
libertieS, privileges, immunities and grants of all our progenitors and
ancestors made or granted to the same Mayor, Aldermen and
Burgesses of the town of Nottingham, or to their predecessors‚ by

augmentations, alterations and explanations of certain liberties,
grants, privileges and franchises as shall seem best to us for the
public good and the common utility of the same town :
Know ye, therefore, that we, affecting the augmentation and
25 emendation of the town aforesaid, as also the good estate and govern-
ment of the same, as is aforesaid, and desiring that there may always
be in the same town and the precincts of the same henceforth for
ever a certain and undoubted manner and form of and for the
keeping of the Peace, and the good rule and government of the
30 people there, and that the town aforesaid henceforth for ever may be
and remain a town of peace and quiet, to the terror of the evil and
the reward of the good, and that our peace and the other deeds of
justice may be there observed without further delay; have of our
especial grace and of our certain knowledge and mere motion, willed,
35 ordained, constituted, and granted, and by these presents do for υς,
our heirs and successors, will, ordain, constitute, declare, and grant
that the said town may and shall be henceforth a free town of itsclf;
and that the Burgesses of the said town of Nottingham by what-
