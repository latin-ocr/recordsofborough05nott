religious principles, but of his courage and capacity, and his incor-
ruptible integrity there can be no question. To these virtues, how-
ever, he certainly did not add the more amiable and attractive ones
of toleration and urbanity, and it is only too plain from the Memoirs
to which he owes his wide-world renown, that he, like his worthy
