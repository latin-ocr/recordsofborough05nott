William and Mary‚ he would seem to have been in the secret service,
perhaps pay, of the deposed monarch; and among other charges
subsequently brought against him, it was alleged that he not only
grossly neglected his duties, but betrayed the secrets of the Town
Council. The majority of the latter were Orangemen, whom
BAWDES was little caresul to please; indeed, it is but too evident
that he took a delight in annoying and thwarting them to the utmost
of his power. The more important discussions of the Council were,
as a consequence, suspended in his presence, and his absence from

by the kings of England; and in the troublous latter years of the
reign of Charles 1., the Corporation appear to have found no small
difficulty in meeting the demands of the Committee of Revenue, the
rent being, on the 19th November, 1645, actually three years in
arrear, and amounting to the sum of ,5191 85. 3d. On the
12th November of the previous year (1644), the Nottingham l'ar-
liamentary Committee petitioned the Revenue sor the discharge of
the inhabitants of Nottingham from payment of the arrears, on the
ground that the see-sarm rents ‘do arise out os such tolls and other
royalties and perquisitos, and out of such other profits as by reason
