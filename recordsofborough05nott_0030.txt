xxiv INTRODUCTION.

that ‘he thought they,’ meaning the company, ‘would swear the
devil burgess' (pp. 278-9).

The comparative paucity of references to the great Protector
may be thought to be, in some degree, compensated by the tolerably
frequent mention os the Roundhead soldiery, the cost of whose
quartering in the town would appear from the Council Minutes to
have been considerable.

It may here be remarked‚ that the date of the letter as to the
training of soldiers, printed at p. 138, was probably some time
between the years 1626 and 1628, sor in the Chamberlains' Account
for the year 1627, there is an entry of payment of soldiers' wages at
the training on the 18th and 19th May (the letter, however, fixes the
muster for the 3rd October), and in the account for 1628-9, there is a
like entry in respect of a training the date of which is not
mentioned.

The editor cannot hope that the present volume is free from
error, or that the work of selection and annotation will give entire
satisfaction to the critic ; but whatever the mistakes or defects of the
book, and whether deemed serious or trivial, the responsibility of
them rests with him alone. For such, no leniency of treatment is
asked or expected, although his pains to avoid them have been con-
siderable. If, on the other hand, the volume should be deemed
worthy of some measure of praise‚ the credit is due, not to him, but
to Sir SAMUEL GEoRoE JOHNSON, without the stimulus of whose
constant encouragement it would certainly never have seen the light,
and to Mr. W. H. STEVENSON‚ MA, whose labours on the previous
volumes have determined the form, and, in no small degree, the
character of the contents of the present one. The model may, after
all, be found to be only distantly approached, and comparison with a
predecessor seldom proves advantageous‚ but the debt itself is
scarcely to be over-estimated, and demands, therefore, in common
sairness, the amplest acknowledgment. At the same time, it should
also be observed, that a wholly independent treatment of material
would have been incompatible with that uniformity of character

which subscribers to the various volumcs have a right to expect from
