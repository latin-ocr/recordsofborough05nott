126 RECORDs OF THE BOROUGH OF NOTTINGHAM. [1627

those to whome day was giuen as for a second paymmt, are neither
called vpon‚ nor haue yett paid in that second payment. Fourthly,
that many shifte themselues from one County to another, and scape1
lending any where. Lastly, that the RefuserS, whome you are to
bind ouer to appeare before the Boord, are neither bound, nor their 5
answers certified, in all wllz'ch cases, you are to vse dilligence, and
strictly to giue vs accompt of your proceedings before the 15th of
July next. And as his Majestie will interprett well where he finds
dilligence to be vsed, soe the neglect herein will be as offensiue to
him, the publique occasions so pressing as they doe, and all the 10
money collected vpon these Loanes, with much more of his owne
treasure, beeing wholy imployed in these publique occasions for
defence of the Realme, Succors of his Masbstie's Allyes‚ and main-
tenance of the cause of Religion, wlzich were the motiues that forced
his Majestie to this course. And this further wee must lett you to Ῑ5
know, wee are not ignorant of that you are the eare-witnesses off;
That such as haue shewed good affeccions and bin forward in yeild-
ing fo theis LoaneS‚ find themselues agreeued that others who stand
in contempt,2 and refuse to lend, fare better then those that are the
lenders, wln'ch is an occasion of discontent to the lenders who haue 20
deserved thancks of his Majcstie, and are not soe to be discouraged,
nor these Refusers and contemners to goe free and vnpunished, which
causes the quicker calling vpon you, and stricter accompt from you
then otherwise should haue needed. And soe wee bid you heartely
farewell. From whitehall the 3oth of June, 1627. 25
