INTRODUCTION. xxi

of the most important are, undoubtedly, the 1⁴2xemplificationof the
Doomsday Book entry (p. 16), and the Exemplification of the Cor-
poration claim to forestal and other rights (p. 33), the original of the
latter of which is embellished with a striking portrait of the reigning
monarch (Charles 11.).1

The presentment at pp. 8-12‚ against Robert IIeald, sor filling up
the Mickletorn hole and removing the mearstone‚ is certainly entitled
to rank among the more curious of the presentments in the Latin
tongue, though, judged by the standard of importance‚ its value is
small. The Latin of this document, as of some others, is far from
impeccable, but the original has been faithsully adhered to, even to
the retention of so barbarous a substitute as that of praeseulcmzcnla
sor praesentalis). Of the translations, it should, perhaps, be observed,
that, in the case of words the exact import of which is disputed, the
most generally received meaning has been adopted. The rendering,
in the Exemplification of the Doomsday Book entry above referred
to, of ‘In Snotz'ngellam est nna ecclesia in dominio regis, ill qemjaccul
iii. mansiones bmgi,’ etc, as, ‘In Snotingeham there is one church in
the king's demesne, wherein are situate iii. dwelling-houses of the
borough,’ etc.‚2 is, no doubt, open to criticism 3 but, in this instance,
the word ecclesia has, rightly or Wrongly, been understood as em-
bracing, by implication at least, not merely the church, but the
wapentake, or the whole of the estate under the church's jurisdiction :
just aS, in the present day, a parish church might stand for the parish
itself, and as the &Velsh word Llcm, used as a prefix, signifies ‘a
churchyard,' ‘an enclosure,’ etc, as well as ‘a church.’ If, however,
ecclesia is to be taken in its restricted sense, the passage would cer-
tainly be more intelligibly translated, ‘In Snotingeham there is one
church in the king‘s demesne to which are adjacent (or appertain)

three mansions (or dwelling-houses> of the borough,' etc.

¹ A portrait of Charles Ι. also adorus the passage in exarctly corresponding tenus:
his Charlcr‚ or, rather, once adorned il, ‘In Snottingliain, in the ‹lenit->nc os {hc
sor the features have been disfigured by King was (is) one church, in ft's'll'rv't were
