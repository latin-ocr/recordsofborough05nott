xxii INTRODUCTION.

With regard to the ‘2'2'22 mansiones,' a writer‚1 whose opinion on
such matters is entitled to the highest respect, claims that three
mauors, not mansions‚ are meant, and that we are to understand that
‘they were laid to, or were subservient to the Church.’ ‘ These three
manors,’ he adds, ‘appear to have constituted the wapentake of the
town, for the western one was not given in the neighbouring wapen—
take of Broxtowe, or the eastern one in that of Thurgarton.’

Such Latin words or phrases (whether they have been adopted
into our language or not) as occur in the English documents in this
volume, are, with some accidental exceptions in the earlier pageS,
printed in italic type. The dates of the meetings of the Common
Council are almost invariably written in Latin in the minute books,
but are here printed in English only, in conformity with the practice
of the former editor of this work.

Of the manuscripts in the English tongue selected for this
volume, little further can be said within the limits os such an
Introduction as the present one. Their general characteristics have
already been indicated, and allusions have been made to some of the
documents which are likely to possess the most general interest for
the student of history. The presentment against John Sherin, dated
April 24, 1626 (p. 108), and that against John Crofts, os the same
date (p. 109), are worthy of passing notice, at least, not only from
the quaint terms in which they are couched, but as evidencing a
savagery of conduct both in master and apprentice which, it may be
poesumed, was more common in the olden time than now. The
ills to which a poor apprentice was sometimes subject in those days
are set forth very vividly in the ‘humble petition’ of John Corby, a
butcher's ‘poor ’prentice‚' printed at p. 156. In this petition, while
alleging that ‘he has ever been willing to please and give content to
his maister and dame,’ he charges thern both with having treated
him in the most barbarous manner, he ‘with great extremity being
sent baresoot and barelegged in the cold winter, and fasting, about
his master’s business, and many times being kept fast until two
