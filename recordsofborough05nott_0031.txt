the editor’s aim.

complete index lately supplied by Dr. R. C. Chicken 1 to DEERING'S
Noltt'ngltczmia‚ which has greatly facilitated such references as hare
had to be made to the latter work for this volume, and would have
been of still more service had not its appearance been so recent.
The value of the Index for any future volume of the Rea-omis of
Noltz'ngltam will, undoubtedly, be very considerable.

The plates comprise fac-similes of the above-mentioned Exem-
plification of that part of the Doomsday Book which relates to
Nottingham, dated June 15, 1635, and a page of the Hall Book, in
the handwriting of Robert Greaves, the Mayor’s or Town Clerk.
The Exemplification is printed in full at pp. 16-2o‚ and the contents
of the page of the Hall Book will be found at pp. 129-130.2
