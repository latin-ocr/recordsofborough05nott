XX INTRODUCTION.

and that they regarded the new Charter, obtained thereupon, as
‘illegal and unjust.' The letters of George Langford‚ Mayon and
Nathaniel Wright, with respect to the new Charter of William and
Mary (pp. 343-347)‚ are of considerable interest, and in the specifica-
tion of ‘the things that are desircd to bc altercd’ (p. 343), the more
objectionable features of the Charters of Charles II. and James II.
are presented in a very clear and succinct form.

Although the whole of the Borough Charters were issued so long
ago as 1890 in a single volume, it has not been thought advisable to
exclude any which belong to the period here embraced, as their
omission might not only have given reasonable ground of complaint
to those who possessed the previous volumes of the Recol‘ds, but not
the Chartae, but would have rendered unintelligible to those un-
acquainted with the charters themselves the various allusions to them
which will be found in the following extracts. The Charter of
Charles 11„ although, as has been said, it was subsequently cancelled,
has a peculiar interest of its own from the circumstances already
mentioned, and it is, moreover, of some importance as being the
first charter in which the appointment of 3 Deputy Recorder is
formally authorized. Recorders had, indeed, long before this, been
in the habit of appointing substitutes, but it seems to have been
without express royal authority, and the deputies who, unlike the
nominal recorders—men of high rank and title generally—were pro-
fessional men, well versed in the law, were sometimes themselves
called ‘learned recorders’ by way of distinction, and sometimes,
‘recorderS,’ without qualification of any kind.

On the various royal visits to the town mentioned in the present
volume, there is, perhaps, no need to dwell. The account given by
BAILEY of all these in his Annals is sufficiently minute, and he has
quoted or epitomized such of the Council Minutes as record them.
A few slight errors into which he has fallen have been duly noted in
their place.

For the Latin documents, other than the Charters, contained in
the present volume, it cannot, perhaps, be claimed that they are of

any very special interest, though some are certainly curious. Two
