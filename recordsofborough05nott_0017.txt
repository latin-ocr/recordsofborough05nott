INTRODUCTION. xi

results are shown wherever they could be ascertained, but, unfor-
tunately‚ in many instances, nothing appears on the presentments
beyond the charges themselves, and there is no other available source
of information. In BAILEY‘S Annals, indeed, there is occasionally‚
as in the case of Luke Bosworth, the reputed ‘wizard,' a fuller
account given than is supplied by the rolls, but, whether these addi-
tional details were drawn from authentic sourceS, now unknown, or
were merely guessed or inferred by the annalist from the imperfect
data still extant, is not easy to determine. That not a few of the
statements in the Annals are inaccurate, is patent enough to any one
who examines the documents on which they profess to be grounded.
Thus, it is said, that in the Hal! Book for the 16th July, 1638, the
year in which Bosworth was presented for witchcraft, there is an
order for the ducking of six women for scolding. There is no such
entry in the Hal! Book of that or any other date, but the Sessions
rolls show that on 16th July, 1638, six women were, by the constables
at the Sessions, presented in succession and by name, as scolds, and
received the punishment on whose inhumanity Bailey has animad-
verted so strongly. The instance is merely a typical‚ not, in any
way, an extraordinary one, for, as has been already remarked, such
presentments were only too common, and why this particular one
should have been selected for such a diatribe, is not very apparent.

In matters of date, the Ammls are, it must be said, as often wrong
as right, but inaccuracies of this kind are, perhaps, more easily
detected by the critic on the look-out sor them, than avoided by the
historian or annalist, whose mind is necessarily divided by considera-
tions at least as important as, and certainly of wider scope and import
than mere dates can ever be. In no censorious spirit, therefore, but
merely as a matter of duty, the mistakes of Bailey have been noted
and rectified in this volume. The example of the earlier volumes
has been followed in this, as in other respects.

The sources, other than those already mentioned, from which the
materials of this volume have been derived, are similar in character
to those described by the previous editor in his various Introductions,

and need not, therefore, be dwelt upon at greater length here. Of
