summoned a Parliament, but not finding that successe therein which
wee had cause to expect, wee are enforced to this course wee are nowc
resolved vpon, which was hastened the rather when our vnavoydable
necessities both at home and abroad emultiplied vpon VS, when our
5 Enemyes greate and mightie preparacions both by Sea and lande
threaten vs dayhe, and when the late disaster (the chaunce of warre),
which hath fallen vpon our dearest vncle, the kinge of Dcnmarke, to
the endaungering of his Royall person, the hazarding of his whole
Army, and the vtter dishartening of all our partie, doe at once call
10 vpon vs and crie in our Hares, that not our owne honor alone, and
the auncient Renowne of this Nacion which is deare vnto VS, but the

true Religion with vs, are in apparent daunger of suffering irre-

Subjects when they shalbe trulie informed from vs os what im-

promise and vndertake on the Royall word of a kinge, which wee
will be jealous1 not to breake with our people‚ that all and everic
of those moneys, which thus wee borrowe of them, shalbe bestowed
or expended but vpon those publique and generall services onlie
