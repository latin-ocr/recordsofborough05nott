of the clock in the asternoons, and could no ways give them
content.’

Hardly less striking than this picture of wretchedness is that
contained in the petition of the ‘poor prisoner,' Richard Evans, to
the Mayor, dated January 15, 1637-8, and printed at p. 186. The
petitioner complains that he is ‘starved for want of clothes and food,'
and owes money to the ‘poor man that tends him,’ and he adds that
‘nothing has been given him this month, so that he is pined and
starved for want of things necessary.’

That freedom of speech, especially to those in office, which is
sometimes claimed as the special prerogative of the present age, was
not unknown even in the seventeenth century, as the ‘articles’ ex-
hibited by Robert Malin, the Sheriff, against John Spencer, and dated
December 18, 1651 (p. 275), sufficiently testify. Such open and
gross abuse in the church itself, and before the most influential men
in the town, is a remarkable instance of licence, and it is not sur-
prising that such a scandalum magnatum, as it has been called,
should have been seriously resented by the Sheriff. The instance is
not a solitary one, for on March 18, 1632-3‚ we find Henry Hill pre-
sented at the Sessions for reviling the Mayor and Mr. Alexander
Staples‚ late Sheriff, at the former's house, in terms not to be
repeated (p. 156), and on November 29, 1700, william Crafts,
described as a framework-knitter‚ was disfranchised for ‘striking
and offering many affronts’ to the Mayor, Samuel XVatkinson
(p- 404)-

On June 1, 1649, also, william White confessed before the Town
Council, to have said of Alderman James that ‘he never did his
neighbours any good‚' and on July 7 following, Richard James was
presented at the Sessions for having called the same Alderman an
intermeddler, a knave, and a fool, a charge which was repeated in
the 'articles' against the same delinquent exhibited before the
Mayor, william Richards, and Alderman william Gregory, on the
14th of the same month (p. 261). On September 27, 1653, a
Thomas Burges had to apologize to the Town Council for having

remarked‚ on the occasion of Robert Throne being sworn burgess,
