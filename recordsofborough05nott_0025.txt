spirit of the Stuarts is still more manifest than in either the Com-
mission or the letters of the ‘martyred’ monarch. Both charters
were cancelled by that of william and Mary, and the originals were
probably destroyed at the same time. They are, as· ΜΓ. W. ΙΙ.
STEVENsON has remarked, ‘historically of interest as illustrating the
attacks made upon municipal privileges by the two sons of Charles I.’
The Charter of Charles II. was intended to supersede all preceding
Cha1·te1·s‚and was only granted on the surrender—the legality of
which was afterwards disputed--of the old Charters. Although it
certainly concedes many of the privileges conferred by the latter,
there are, nevertheless, some restrictions and exemptions not found
in thern, which would be but ill calculated to reconcile the town to
the surrender of former Charters. The circumstances of the sur-
render itself are wrapped in some obscurity, but it appears from a
minute in the Council Book of July 5, 1682, that the question of the
surrender being put to the vote of the Council, the votes were even,
fourteen and fourteen, and the casting vote of the Mayor, ΜΓ.
Gervase wilde, settled the debate, that the charters were to be sur-
rendered (p. 323). In a copy ‘case for the new chartei· of william
and Maryss which has only recently come into the possession of the
Corporation,1 and appears to be of nearly contemporaneous date
with the Charter, it is alleged that ‘the Nottingham Charter was
surrendered in '82 by three or four persons who in ye night broke
open the trunk where the towne’s Seale waS‚ and affixed it to an
instrument purporting [to be] a surrender, upon which surrender, the
town had a new Charter, granted by King Charles 11„ and were
made a new Corporation. The late King James turned all out again
by a Mandamus, and then incorporated those persons who came in
by Mandamus, by a new Charter from him’ The above account of
the surrender is, in some measure, confirmed by a Council minute of
August 30, 1689, in which it is stated that the (Louncil ‘arc and ever
were for the old Charter, and ever did and do look upon ye prc-
tended Surrender of yat Charter to be fraudulent and surreptitiouss
