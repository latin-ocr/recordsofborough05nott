INTRODUCTION.

Although the period covered by this volume may not unfairly
claim to be one of the most eventful in the annals of our country,
it has to be regretfully admitted that a vast proportion of the
Nottingham records of the epoch are of a much less interesting
character than might, from this consideration, have been anticipated.
In mere bulk, indeed, the documents greatly surpass those of any
preceding period, but the exceeding dryness of the contents of
many of them is but too well calculated to abate the ardour of the
sanguine investigator. The residue, however, contain matter that it
is hoped may be of some interest for the general reader as well as
for the antiquary; and the minutes of the Common Council, in
particular, which have been largely drawn upon for the present
volume, are valuable for the light they throw upon our local history
during the ‘Great Rebellion' of the seventeenth century. The
references to the military operations, the defensive ones especially,
in the town and immediate vicinity during the Civil XVar, are toler-
ably frequent, and Colonel Hutchinson, a name, it has been rather
sarcastically and unkindly observed, dearer to the ‘small-souled’
antiquarian than that of the Protector, figures somewhat prominently‚
if not invariably to advantage, in certain pages of the Hall Books‚
though, on the other hand, the allusions to Cromwell himself are, if
significant enough, much slighter and less frequent than his superior
importance might make desirable, and add little or nothing to our
knowledge of his character and career, or of his relations to our
town.

It is not a little singular that there should be no direct reference,

either in the Council Minutes or in any contemporary document in
