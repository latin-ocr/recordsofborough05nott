viii INTRODUCTION.

the possession of the Corporation, to so notable a circumstance as
the raising of the standard by Charles I. on Standard Hill.

The silence as to other occurrenceS, less remarkable, perhaps, but
by no means unimportant, is scarcely more intelligible. The dis-
mantling os the picturesque old castle by the redoubtable Colonel‚
and the subsequent angry visit of Cromwell, whose supposed designs
dictated the measure, are wholly ignored.

The minutes during the Commonwealth period have little or no
bearing on the greater political events, and are singularly dry and
meagre for the whole of the reign of Charles 11„ a reign which,
however reprehensible from the standpoint of the moralist‚ cannot
justly be branded even by him as either dull or uninstructive. So
sparse, indeed, are the entries, and so commonplace, and, from any
modern point of view, unimportant, are most of the resolutions they
record, that one might be tempted to imagine that an almost
universal lethargy had seized the Town Council during the not
inconsiderable number of years which intervened between the acces-
sion of the second Charles and his death.

Though the books are, by no means, of large dimensions, very
few of the leaves are well filled, and the number of blank pages in
each is certainly remarkable. On one of the many blank pages of
the Hall Book for the year 1675, an unknown hand of somewhat
later date has written the Lucretiam lament, ‘Quantum est ilc rebus
inane J'1 but whether the writer was struck with the unsatisfactory
character of mundane things in general, or of the Council proceed-
ings in particular, does not appear. On a blank page of the Hall
Book for 1672, there is the following lachrymose line: ‘Quantum
flevi in hymnis et canticis Ecclesiae tuael’2 and in this instance it
certainly appears clear enough that the grief expressed was not
inspired by contemplation of the state of municipal affairs.
