INTRODUCTION. XV

From the vicissitudes of fortune experienced by many persons in
the two great revolutions of the seventeenth century, the Mayor's (or
Town) Clerks were by no means exempt. During the earlier years
of the reign of Charles I., and before the outbreak of the Civil &Van
the Mayor's Clerk, ROBERT GREAVEs, appears to have discharged 1115
duties to the satisfaction of the Town CounciL and it is noticeable
that the resolutions recorded in the Minute Books of this period are
of a distinctly conservative character, and occasionally betray that
dread of innovation which specially characterized the measures of
the royalist party. With this dread, however, there is sometimes
blended an infusion of Puritanic piety, or what looks very like it, as
in the Council Minute of September 26, 1636, in which the ‘com-
pany,' refusing to allow the Sheriffs, Thomas &Volley and Richard
Turpin, any allowance in lieu of tolls for the yet unfinished bridges,
recommend them (the Sheriffs) to ‘refer themselves to God's pro-
videam, and not to bring an innovation which in succeeding times
always proves dangerous and obnoxious' (p. 176). 111 1116 Civil XVar,
GREAVES remained loyal to the cause of the King, and even helped
him actively at Newark, in consequence of which he incurred the
displeasure of the Council, the majority of whom had by this time
declared themselves ParliamentarianS, and on August 14, 1644, he was
voted unfit to be continued Town Clerk, and WILLIAM FLAMSTEAD
was elected in his place. On 151 August, 1645, writs were obtained
for removing GREAVES from the office of Clerk to the statutes, and
appointing a substitute (pp. 26, 27, and 28), and on 12th September
following, the requirements of the writs were carried into effect by
the ‘amoval’ of GREAVES‚ and the substitution of FLAMSTEAI)
(p- 237)-

The full official style of the Clerk of the Statutes is given in
Vol. iii. (p. 434), and in the Introduction to Vol. i., it 15 explained
that the King’s seal was sent to twelve towns, Nottingham being one
(pp. xv.-xvi.). In the Statute of Merchants (statutum de illem-alors-
bns), more commonly known as the Statute of Acton-Burnell, made
in 11 Edward Ι. and anno Domini 1283, the additional direction 15
